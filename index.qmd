## Hello there! 👋

I'm Luca Modica, full-stack developer and aspirant machine learning engineer / AI researcher, graduated at University of Turin in Computer Science. 👨🏻‍💻

Also thanks to my thesis, I expand my topic of interest to social computing and HCI, in particular about the gamification of platforms 🕹️ (check out my bachelor's thesis work [here](https://github.com/lucamodica/bachelors-thesis)!).

My current dream is to intersect these topics with my recent passion in artificial intelligence, in particular about SOTA neural networks 🧠 (Kaggle profile [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lucamodica)).

## Interest ✨
Addicted by code, amazed by AI and affascinated by data science. 🤖 Food&Beer lover 🍔🍻, owner of a doggo 🐶 and average book enjoyer. 📖

I have a secret love for penguins. Below you will find a scatterplot of three of the many species, as a sign of appreciation. 💓🐧

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
g = sns.FacetGrid(sns.load_dataset('penguins'), hue='species', height=3, aspect=3.5/1.5)
g.map(plt.scatter, 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm').add_legend()
```
