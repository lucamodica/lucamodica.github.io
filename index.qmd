Hello there! My name is Luca Modica.

I am a __fellow researcher for the Social Computing group__ at the University of Turin. Also thanks to my [bachelor's thesis](https://github.com/lucamodica/bachelors-thesis), I have interests in social computing and HCI, in particular the gamification of platforms.

My current dream is to became a machine learning engineer / AI researcher, while exploring the world. For this reason, I will pursue a Master's Degree in Data Science and AI at the Chalmers University of Technology, GÃ¶teborg.

## Projects

In my free time I usually read, go outside jogging, play videogames and also do some random coding. You can find most of my code project and experiments in my [Github page](https://github.com/lucamodica) and [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/lucamodica).
